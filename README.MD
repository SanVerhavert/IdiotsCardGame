# Idiots [the card game]
These are the files for a webpage in to play the card game Idiots. You can find the rules this project is based on here: https://gamerules.com/rules/idiot/ 
(I have no affiliation what so ever to this site)  

This is just a repo to practice some programming skills. Note there is no index page. This will be added if and once this page is hosted somewhere.

## Play the game?
This page should run in any browser... In the future I might host the page somewhere. In the mean time, just `git clone` and load the html page in a browser.

Have fun!
